## Web3D Jumping Frog

Something from when I was still a noob at coding ðŸ™ƒ

### About

A jumping frog using the X3DOM library.

### Requirements
* The X3DOM library must be downloaded for the animation to work. [Download Link](https://www.x3dom.org/nodes/)
* The path of the library must be specified in lines 9 and 10.

For example:
```
9 | <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="<X3DOM PATH HERE>/x3dom.css"/>
10| <script type="text/javascript" src="<X3DOM PATH HERE>/x3dom.js">
```
## Running
The animation has only been tested with Google Chrome. As a result, other browsers may be incompatible.
